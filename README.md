# Description

This repository contains FEATHER (Force Extension Analysis using a Testable Hypothesis for Event Recognition), a freely available technique for finding rupture events in force spectroscopy data.

# Installing

Although FEATHER has interfaces for Matlab (tested with version 2017a), Igor (tested with (6.37) and Python (2.7), Python 2.7 is needed for FEATHER. The easiest way to install Python 2.7 and the dependencies is the free Anaconda:

https://www.anaconda.com/download

You will need the following libraries

numpy
scipy

# Running

Each language (Matlab, Python, and Igor Pro) has an example file which shows FEATHER working on a polyprotein force-extension curve. The files are located in App<X>, where <X> is the language name. In particular:

- Matlab: Run 'feather_example.m' in the AppMatlab folder
- Igor Pro: Run 'Example/MainFEATHER.ipf' in the AppIgor folder
- Python: Run 'main_unit_feather.py' from the AppPython/UnitTest folder
